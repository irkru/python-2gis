# python-2gis

A Python library for accessing the 2gis API (http://api.2gis.ru).

## Versioning and API stability

API stability isn't guaranteed before **1.0.0** version. Versioning is propagated by [semver.org](http://semver.org>).

When version **1.0.0** will be released the API will be frozen, and any changes which aren't backwards compatible will force a major version bump.
